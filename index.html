<p>What if I told you this one image, this one 'proof' was the difference between 'being a self-obsessed intellectual, lost always in abstract thoughts', 'someone so lost they fell into homelessness; they don't even know how deeply we love them, how we're doing all we can to help', and 'not open source? it would be better if they weren't selfish..', 'they're only selling their books for so low because they know they're suffering just like the rest of us..'--between these four judgments or 'I love the thought they did this.. I should.. help'?</p>

<p class='small'>This was the potential I understood back at the University of Chicago at age 20; these were the first versions of the books I could hope would help.</p>
<p class='small'>Please don't feel obliged to help just by reading as quickly as you may.. please also don't feel obliged to buy the book immediately, though if you do enjoy reading and know others who would, please do consider the time of the mail carriers and order maybe 4 pairs of books for friends, or maybe just the first person you have a meaningful conversation with after reading the books.</p>

<p>Had we arranged our cities by true principles, every window may've had a view of acres of trees and flowers.</p>
<p class="small">
I've written toward a new kind of community where instead of having most people drive most days past lines of buildings they do not use, we would walk through the garden to foundations we visit often,- among these could be the theatre, the office, the school, the library, the beauty salon, the studio, the lounge. Given the need of far fewer buildings, far fewer roads, our communities could express wealth within the beauty of nature.</p>
<hr/><br/>
<img src="../theaaara.github.io/title.png" alt="Two Roses of Sable"/>
<p class="small">Two Roses will be a community with only 290 buildings—20 foundations, 70 banquet halls, and 200 manors—built within a 2400 acre garden. We may enjoy here both natural beauty and the labors of others who may fulfill every need,- we may walk through the garden to see our doctors, to see actors perform in the theatre, to have clothiers fashion clothing for us in the boutique.</p>
<p class="small">The book describes the ethics of the community,- the division of labors, the economic architecture, the calendar, the paintings presented in the foundations, the process of determining the community's schedules.</p>
<p>This book is written toward a potential nowhere expressed in modern society, with the hope of gathering a community of individuals who'd prefer a life in the garden.</p>

<p>This myth tells a story of how the gods fell from grace, how life arose of this fall.</p>
<p class="small">My hope for this book is that someday it will be present upon the shelves of the library of Two Roses. I believe this myth can only be wholly and beautifully expressed through the labors of a community in the garden.</p>

<p class='small'><b>[private email hoped to reach the intended recipient privately, though sadly the intended recipient no longer owns starrysoso88@..com]</b> I thought you of all people would appreciate the bitter irony of a woman scorned.. hopefully not because you have <i>ever</i> felt you've ever been a woman scorned, but simply because.. because you care. How nice would it have been if.. for someone who graduates from the University of Chicago with honors.. a computer science major.. if they were invited to share their thoughts.. instead of a numeric question,- <b>how would you rate your internship with the IT department?</b> 1 2 3 4 5 - they ask, well, hmm.. about what you would imagine social media would look like? Like, what an official page could look like? You have proof you've graduated, proof of your identity, access to any information so you can automate finances for you and any number of your peers, even if they graduated from other universities! I finally made a little presentation last night (how convenient.. they saved the save time 12:32am)--what I may've imagined this page would look like.</p>
