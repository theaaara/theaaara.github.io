<p>What if I told you this one image, this one 'proof' was kinda the difference between <span class="small">'being a self-obsessed intellectual, lost always in abstract thoughts', 'someone so lost they fell into homelessness; they don't even know how deeply we love them, how we're doing all we can to help', and 'not open source? it would be better if they weren't selfish..', 'they're only selling their books for so low because they know they're suffering just like the rest of us..'—between these four judgments or 'I love the thought they did this.. I should.. help'?</span></p>

<p class='small'>This was the potential I understood back at the University of Chicago at age 20; these were the first versions of the books I could hope would help. I haven't felt this happy in almost 17 years, back when I was 17.</p>
<p class='small'>Please don't feel obliged to help just by reading as quickly as you may.. please also don't feel obliged to buy any of the books immediately, though if you do enjoy reading on paper and know others who prefer natural paper as well, please do consider the time of the mail carriers and order maybe 4 pairs of books for friends, or maybe just the first person you have a meaningful conversation with after reading the books.</p>

<p>Had we arranged our cities by true principles, every window may've had a view of acres of trees and flowers.</p>
<p class="small">
I've written toward a new kind of community where instead of having most people drive most days past lines of buildings they do not use, we would walk through the garden to foundations we visit often,- among these could be the theatre, the office, the school, the library, the beauty salon, the studio, the lounge. Given the need of far fewer buildings, far fewer roads, our communities could express wealth within the beauty of nature.</p>

<img src="../theaaara.github.io/title.png" alt="Two Roses of Sable"/>
<p class="small">Two Roses will be a community with only 290 buildings—20 foundations, 70 banquet halls, and 200 manors—built within a 2400 acre garden. We may enjoy here both natural beauty and the labors of others who may fulfill every need,- we may walk through the garden to see our doctors, to see actors perform in the theatre, to have clothiers fashion clothing for us in the boutique.</p>
<p class="small">The book describes the ethics of the community,- the division of labors, the economic architecture, the calendar, the paintings presented in the foundations, the process of determining the community's schedules.</p>
<p>This book is written toward a potential nowhere expressed in modern society, with the hope of gathering a community of individuals who'd prefer a life in the garden.</p>

<p>This myth tells a story of how the gods fell from grace, how life arose of this fall.</p>
<p class="small">My hope for this book is that someday it will be present upon the shelves of the library of Two Roses. I believe this myth can only be wholly and beautifully expressed through the labors of a community in the garden.</p>

<div class='line'><h2>How this happened, a story in 6 photos</h2>
<p>One day, metaphorically, twin arcs of lightning came down from the heavens, and struck two random pieces of trash very near me, and I understood an exact conductive pattern ov the arcs of lightning; miraculously, the trash on the street began to collapse, and it was as great a marvel as when an innocent man was cruxified on the cross, when lightning suddenly struck and brought down the stone temple..</p>
<p class="small"><i>I knew then I would need to become a divine prophetess, if only to speak against the trash that our god had already condemned, yet to speak as a prophetess, of the day when there would be heaven on earth, the land cleansed of waste, the wine dark sea pure.. as it should have always been.</i></p></div>
<img class='fixed' src="https://theaaara.github.io/parcel.png" alt="Parcel, a trashy thought"/>
<div class="line"><p>Parcels! Use.. parcels! Somehow it didn't make sense as anything but a satire. Cloth parcels that didn't need to be wastefully recomposed by modern industrial methods, aesthetically superior to modern bags.. less wasteful too.. It would need images.. someone to help make the images would help.. otherwise I could do those myself if really no one wanted to..</p></div>
<img class='fixed' src="https://theaaara.github.io/changeofcolor.jpg" alt="documented documentation progress"/>

<div class="line"><p>Look! our work can be better than modern work! No one believed me; it was too outlandish, an idle fantasy of one clearly fallen into madness.</p><p class="small">'but then you'd have to look at the screen again..' no one was bold enough to admit could be enriched by time at the screen. <i>no one until me..</i> thought Thea.</p><p class='small'>'is it like a comic book?' people would ask. 'no..' I would begin <i>how may I politely suggest I hate comic books? without offending anyone retrospectively..?</i></p></div>
<img class='fixed' src="https://theaaara.github.io/parcelwithshoulderstrap.png" alt="more trash, more progress"/>
<div class="line"><p>'Look!' I wanted to say. 'Progress is possible even without a corporate sanctioned reward!' <i>look.. I thought.. what satires with 'look'..</i>'We all know the burden of walking to work each day, our commute a pleasant saunter through the hills, our home surround by trees.' <i>though sadly, not enough people would see it as anything more than arrogant mockery.. though it truly would help.. we'd have more freedom, more time, more fresh air, a healthier and more natural way of life.. if only the most arrogant among us, the elite, had a sense of imagination.. one could dream.. not for my father, but in relation to my father, ov my father..</i></p></div>
<img class='fixed' src="https://theaaara.github.io/unmoneyfirstpainting.jpg" alt="a tribute to the classic?"/>
<div class="line"><p>Then of course you need to make it cool for the middle class to like and create art too, because they have no idea.. <i>again.. the children are our only hope.. children, in unison, squeal with delight!</i> though sadly they did not in that moment; how would the children ever communicate to an adult?</p></div>

How nice would it have been if.. for someone who graduates from the University of Chicago with honors.. a computer science major.. if they were invited to share their thoughts.. instead of a numeric question,- <span class='irony'><b>how would you rate your internship with the IT department?</b> 1 2 3 4 5</span> - they ask, well, hmm.. about what you would imagine social media would look like? Like, what an official page could look like? You have proof you've graduated, proof of your identity, access to any information so you can automate finances for you and any number of your peers, even if they graduated from other universities! I finally made a little presentation last night (how convenient.. they saved the save time 12:32am)—what I may've imagined this page would look like.</p>
<p class='small'>please, only you would understand the humiliation I've endured.. to have lost an email address.. now so publicly revealed.. here.. my old email address <b>theaaara8@gmail.com</b>; no one else would email me before reading the books, and sadly no one wanted to read the books before :(.. everyone else, please read the books first; my new email is written in the books</p>
<p class='small'><b>[text from image above]</b> 'okay, but how will it make money?' 'the children'<br/>
'everyone speaks of the children; but how is your ideal going to help the children?' 'two focuses of education—vocational and political—resolving across 4 levels of schooling'<br/>
'let me guess.. 4 levels of schooling—elementary, middle, high, university—without strict limits of age of graduation? the government mints—' 'that's exactly what happens.'.<br/>
'..the government mints a coin for each child, and the child may trade the coin for a room in a true home?' 'yes, that's what I expected you to say..'<br>
'<b>do you have pics?</b>' 'of course I have pics; however, I wish your concerns were of how you could help..'<p>May as well share the intention publicly at this point; I know I'm about to be publicly humiliated anyway,- the impending homelessness, the onset of the epilepsy.. yes.. even the tarot cards conspired, statistically conspired against me.</p><p class='small'>I would need to become who I always had been.. who then people told me I would have to be more like.. <i>sadly, the thought brought no joy.. and I couldn't fake the joy I'd felt.

<p>At least there was the hope that someone would understand.. or, well, if they didn't understand that, they would.. *that* or, well, if they didn't understand that, they would.. *that* hmm.. a predictible pattern, at least I hope I don't see another 'more common predictible pattern' too predictibly; though sadly, even this was too much to ask for.. the men.. how they treat you.. it's 'very cool', 'sexy..' <i>that voice again..

<div class="line"><p>Then, one after one, thought experiment would manifest as truth,- a man stole someone's laptop while he was sitting in a coffeeshop.

<div class="line"><p><b>MODERN TRIBUTE</b></p><p>My favorite actor as a youth was Robin Williams. I felt he sought to gesture toward empathy for they accused of suffering madness, and I found that very quickly, one begins to understand 'madness' simply by sifting through the concerns of one accused.. Unfortunately, after we actually <i>are</i> accused, people dismiss our original empathy as something trivial,- 'of course you understand ''empathy'' now.. we're literally telling you what's wrong with you.' or 'can't you be grateful? hasn't this given you some sense of purpose?' though sadly, my concern still rests with the one who would have doubted me <i>before</i> I had time to prove my original intention, the value of a first memory in nature and having time to sift through one's feelings without the distraction of the modern city, below or around you.</p></div>
