	<div class="line">Could God forgive a Christmas card that was circulated on the modern web.. even though it was published <i>after</i> Christmas Eve? <i>even if</i> it were slightly satirical?</div>
<div class="line">Could God forgive a president elect who spoke toward 'the russians'.. though <i>against</i> the rights of russians who emigrated to this country with the hope their intellectual property would be valued here? even moreso than property value? even moreso than arbitrary political divisions like the need to have distinct states within the United States?</div>
<div class="line">Could God forgive an ATHEIST who found faith in love.. <i>before</i> knowing love toward God, yet who felt they understood true love and felt divine bliss at the thought of inspiring a political ideal <b>before</b> having fallen in love with the first beautiful woman who was polite to him?</div>
<div class="line">Could God forgive a preseident elect who inspired fear yet having been elected in relation to the hope of empowering every individual, even a woman who suffered of nightmares his faith inspired? who found comfort only in the thought of comforting others.. by the argument that his speech was satirical.. while 'fearing' it truly was not..</div>
<div class="line">Could God forgive a DIVINE PROPHETESS who 8 years ago had foretold <i>though without scientific proof</i> that she would need to forgive the president elect for not freeing her from tyranny sooner than he may've hoped to empower her, even <i>with</i> 8 undisrupted years in office? even if she found no pleasure in the thought of sex, and felt her body more precious as a gesture against blind faith in another child.. her own pleasure somehow less valuable to her than the thought of a another individual descending as savior messiah.. somehow less comforting than the thought of a DIVINE PROPHETESS speaking, if only slightly satirically, of her deep need to free the president elect, a DIVINE SAVIOR MESSIAH?</div>
<div class="line">Could God forgive a transgender woman who sought to free the president elect of <i>his fears</i>, that a woman would speak against him, yet without appealing first to the atheists.. who had voted against him..</div>
<div class="line">Sadly, I have been all of these things unto you, and yet not one individual has felt empowered to help me since I expressed a complex prediction 12 years ago at the University of Chicago.. that no one would seek to understand me, though I'd felt divine bliss. Whether their own sense of shame, their own pride in love of God and Jesus, yet somehow hypocritical failure to live by his word, to love thy enemy.. a principle even a satiric russian may've hoped to understand.. if only he had had more faith in Dostoyevsky at the time he left russia.. that an ATHETISTIC BITCH AT HEART (,- Thea Aara, author of this page) would recognize ov a linguistic principle..</div>
<div class="line"><i>Please</i> don't assume my first love wouldn't prefer to know my thoughts instead of fearing the memory of my urgent need to express a proof of the depths of my fear so deeply the memory of me still disgusts her.</div>
<div class="line"><i>Please</i> don't in the name of divine precedent insist a true man would marry her and give her child and pleasure.. though if you have already married Sarah Catherine Stambaugh.. please don't assume it would grant her serenity to hide my intention to apologize for every fear I've confided to her and to others.. to feel only her replies were meaningful.. to suffer deeply that no one else had asked what it meant to me. I'd hoped there would be even one individual who, across almost 17 years, asked why the memory of her had been so deeply meaningful to me <b>before</b> offering me the advice to move on.. I had hoped to listen to everyone's advice, to listen to literally every advice that was offered without contradiction.. even advices I couldn't believe would make either of us happier.. if only to prove I was willing to listen.. and please do not assume I could forgive even you sooner than I could forgive our god..</div>
<div class="line"><i>Please</i> understand there is no answer in money if an individual may only hope their writing may be respected more than their writing is changed by graphics.. please.. I value the preservation of the truth moreso than I value the immediate expression of individual whim.. even if God still falls, as evident by the historical record, into selfish whims sometimes,- to punish the epileptic, the asian, the old man - with living paralysis, bodily degredation, and spiritual degredation (as a hope toward an ugly ethic of modern science must be expressed through the study of ugly writing, an ugly and cruel culture). I would sooner have a doctress cut my sex to gesture against the need of another life, another child, eternal return to a condition that is suffering even for God, than I would impose upon her an obligation to marry me; though I would sooner ask her what the gesture would mean to her than I would have any surgery done toward a sense of solace, of serenity and happiness for everyone else..</div>
<div class="line"><i>Please</i> understand I would wait forever if only to have another meaningful conversation with her, for she was my first true love, my first kiss, and she remains my only memory of hope toward pleasure, joy, love, not only for myself, but as I understand the people, the high need of a true politic.
<div class="line"><b>Please understand</b> this is the deepest expression of my hope I could publish on this night.. that the woman who has been kindest and most beautiful to me may read this and be assured freedom to return to this moment.. even if the thought of eternal return is fearful to her, to the author of this writing, to much of the academic community, and self defeating even for God our god. Yet please remember I'd wait forever if only to never die, that I may keep the memory of the passion I'd known ov my own lips, the most beautiful passion I remember, though not the most joyful. So please tell the most beautiful woman you know of this page, even if you fear she <i>is</i> if only in a spiritual sense.. all too much like her I've written this too; and please do not insist she read this text when she doesn't want to; though please allow this page to remain as long as you believe she or even our god may wish to know the truth of what happened.. at the time she was born.. 6 days.. Sarah.. before the summer solstice.. the past life memories.. of Thea.. born Aaron.. 6 days after the summer solstice in the year 1991.. become Aara, who understood the name Catherine in relation to past life memories, though would never wish to be known the husband nor wife of her.. the empress, though he was born with the name Alexander, the famed ancient emperor.. the thought of a story written in the stars, a Star of the word of God, though known only ov our god ov the holy roman empereror who was recognized as Caesar Augustus, who had suffered epilepsy, had only he counted deeply enough to understand the political problem ov the number 19|91, roman numeral XIX; ov the thought of infinity, eternity (8).</div>
<div class="line">Please forgive my enemy, he who would sooner think <i>forgive me my self empowerment</i> sooner than he would recognize how deeply I sought to empower everyone like him since age 16.. though could not prove it by age 20, nor by 33.. sooner than I could prove life was statistically correlated to DEATH (33-20).</div>
<div class="line">Please forgive my enemy, he who wishes to be regarded as strong, to know I've been weak; I have never been weak. Even while locked in a building, accused of madness, without hope of ever proving I'd predicted this same existential condition arisen ov the same depth of academic concern I'd known while a student at the University of Chicago, I had prayed for eternal return, knowing it would be the deepest offense to one I could not hope to apologize toward soon enough.</div>
<div class="line"><b><i>without wasting a method of my own design, this is the image I'd published upon my page yesterday, an apology of sorts.. for having a christmas wish that didn't come true any year since age 16, almost 17 years ago..</i> just waiting for a sign.. to know empathy for even she, even he.. who valu'd reason above rhyme.</b></div>
